Subsetting locus of control questions, victimisation experiences, and demographics 
```{r}

loc = select(loc, 2, 23:63)

```

Renaming variables
```{r}

Locus of control score 
```{r}

```

Changing all answers that are not no or yes to NA (to conduct t-tests, which requires a factor with only two levels)
```{r}

locdf[locdf=="Do not want to tell"] <- NA
locdf[locdf=="Do not know"] <- NA

```


Creating a column for the added points for each participant
```{r}

#dataframe = within(locdf, {
#    loc = ifelse(points < "12"| points > "12", 1, 2)
# })

locdf$loc = if_else(locdf$points < 13, true = 1, false = 2)

```

Checking for normality before conducting tests 
```{r}

ggplot(locdf, aes(points)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour = "darkblue", fill = "lightblue", binwidth = 3) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean(locdf$points), sd(locdf$points)), size = 1) + 
  labs(x = "Points", y = "Density") + 
  ggtitle("Points") +
  theme_minimal()

qplot(sample = locdf$points)
